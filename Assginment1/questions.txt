1) Searching algorithms (Linear, binary, ternary)

2) Sorting algorithms: Design a menu-driven program that includes the functions of sorting algorithms. These sorting algorithms are Merge, insertion, heap, bubble, selection, count, and bucket sort. 

3) WAP to implement binary tree traversal algorithms recursively and non-recursively.

4) Merge Sort:
         a) WAP to merge k-sorted lists.
         b) 3-way merge sort

5) Quick Sort:
        a) Implement Quicksort by considering the pivot element position as - first, last, and random. For all three cases, print the intermediate steps as well.
        b) ith order statistics (ith minimum or maximum value in an array)

6) Implement Large integer multiplication algorithm (Karatsuba's algorithm)

7) WAP to implement maximum sum subarray problem.
